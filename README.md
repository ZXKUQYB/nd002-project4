# Wrangle and Analyze the Dataset of WeRateDogs Twitter Archive

This is a personal project which focuses on the *data wrangling* step in the entire data analysis process, along with presenting several insights extracted from the cleaned datasets.

### Instructions

The project is composed of 3 separate Jupyter notebook files.

- [01_wrangle_report.ipynb](https://github.com/ZXKUQYB/nd002-project4/blob/main/01_wrangle_report.ipynb) : The beginning part of the project, which gives an introduction of the project itself, as well as providing information about the datasets used in the project.
- [02_wrangle_act.ipynb](https://github.com/ZXKUQYB/nd002-project4/blob/main/02_wrangle_act.ipynb) : The wrangling part of the project. All the program code written for the wrangling and plotting can be found here.
- [03_act_report.ipynb](https://github.com/ZXKUQYB/nd002-project4/blob/main/03_act_report.ipynb) : The ending part of the project, which presents the discovered insights and concludes the project.

Feel free to download any of the Jupyter notebook files listed above to have a look at the project contents.

Like previous projects, it is recommended to use a temporary Jupyter server offered by [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/try) to setup a test run of these notebooks. Be sure to choose **JupyterLab** when you get your temporary Jupyter server, since it comes with all the Python modules needed for this project already installed. And of course, you can also run it in your own local environment instead, but the instructions to configure a local environment will not be covered here.

### Additional Information

In this repository, there are also some static, soft copies of the Jupyter notebook files created in HTML format by using [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io), which are provided for your convenience. You can see most of the project results directly online without running program code, especially when you use some online preview services such as [GitHub & BitBucket HTML Preview](https://htmlpreview.github.io/) to render them. This means you should still download these HTML documents if you want to ensure you read the fully rendered contents.

### Issues

It seems that some of the plots in the project created by Bokeh will not show the toolbar correctly if you are using the latest version (currently 2.4.1) to run the program code in the Jupyter notebook. Downgrade the Bokeh version to 2.3.3 and the problem should be gone.
